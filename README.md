## Knowledge Base Showcase

We've introduced the new `knowledge-dark` skin and a set of components to enhance the readability and professionalism of your documentation.

### 1. Optimized Info Blocks

Use beautifully styled `<blockquote>` to highlight important information, tips, or warnings.

> **Tip**: The `knowledge-dark` skin provides excellent typography and readability for documentation.

### 2. Collapsible Content

For lengthy content like installation instructions or configuration code, use the collapsible `details` shortcode to keep your page clean.

```go-html-template
{{</* details "Click to see installation guide" */>}}
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
{{</* /details */>}}
```

**Result:**
<details>
<summary>Click to see installation guide</summary>

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`

</details>

### 3. Enhanced Code Highlighting

Code is the core of technical documentation. This theme provides a clear and readable code highlighting scheme.

```javascript
// Example: Fetch data from an API
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('User not found');
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
  }
}
```

### 4. Professional Data Tables

Use well-designed tables to present structured data clearly.

| Table of Contents | Auto-generated page navigation | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| Collapsible Sections | Organize long-form content | ‚úÖ Implemented |
