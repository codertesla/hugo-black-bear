This article demonstrates the enhanced features of the Hugo Black Bear theme optimized for knowledge bases and documentation sites.

## Table of Contents

The table of contents is automatically generated for articles with more than 400 words. You can disable it by setting `toc: false` in the front matter.

## Styled Blockquotes

Blockquotes are beautifully styled for highlighting important information:

> **Note:** The Hugo Black Bear theme with knowledge-dark style provides excellent typography and readability for documentation.

> **Pro Tip:** Use blockquotes to emphasize key points or quotes from authoritative sources.

## Collapsible Content

Use collapsible sections to organize lengthy content:

{{< details "Click to see installation instructions" >}}
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Build for production with `npm run build`
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Advanced Configuration" "open" >}}
You can pass a second parameter "open" to make the section expanded by default.

This is useful for sections that most readers will want to see but can still be collapsed if needed.
{{< /details >}}

## Code Examples

The theme provides enhanced code highlighting:

```javascript
// Example: Fetch data from an API
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('User not found');
    }
    const userData = await response.json();
    return userData;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```
